                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

**This styling is an extra step which is likely not required.**

Why is it here? To ensure:

1. the element is able to have focus and selection.
2. if element was to `flash` render it has minimal visual impact.
3. less flakyness with selection and copying which **might** occur if the textarea element is not visible.

The likelihood is the element won't even render, not even a flash, so some of these are just precautions. However in IE the element is visible whilst the popup box asking the user for permission for the web page to copy to the clipboard. Place in top-left corner of screen regardless of scroll position.

## Usage

You will need Node.js installed on your system.

```bash
$ npm i @uiw/copy-to-clipboard
```

```js
import copyTextToClipboard from '@uiw/copy-to-clipboard';

copyTextToClipboard('test', (isCopy) => {
  console.log('isCopy:', isCopy);
});
```

Or manually download and link [copy-to-clipboard](https://unpkg.com/@uiw/copy-to-clipboard/dist/) in your HTML, It can also be downloaded via [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/@uiw/copy-to-clipboard/dist/):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@uiw/copy-to-clipboard/dist/copy-to-clipboard.umd.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
copyTextToClipboard('test', (isCopy) => {
  console.log('isCopy:', isCopy);
});
</script>

## Markdown Features

### Supports for CSS Style

Use HTML comments [`<!--rehype:xxx-->`](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/rehype-attr)<!--rehype:style=color: red;--> to let Markdown support style customization.

```markdown
## Title
<!--rehype:style=display: flex; height: 230px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-size: 38px;-->

Markdown Supports **Style**<!--rehype:style=color: red;-->
```

### Support for [GFM footnotes](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-09-30-footnotes-now-supported-in-markdown-fields/)

```markdown
Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference.
```

## Support dark-mode/night-mode

By default, the [`dark-mode`](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/dark-mode/) is automatically switched according to the system. If you need to switch manually, just set the `data-color-mode="dark"` parameter for body. 

```html
<html data-color-mode="dark">
```

```js
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-color-mode', 'dark')
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-color-mode', 'light')
```

Inherit custom color variables by adding [`.wmde-markdown-var`](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-markdown-preview/blob/a53be1e93fb1c2327649c4a6b084adb80679affa/src/styles/markdown.less#L1-L193) selector.

```jsx
const Demo = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="wmde-markdown-var"> </div>
      <MarkdownPreview source="Hello World!" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Set the `light` theme.

```diff
<MarkdownPreview
  source="Hello World!"
  wrapperElement={{
+    "data-color-mode": "light"
  }}
/>
```

## Development

Runs the project in development mode.  

```bash
# Step 1, run first,
# listen to the component compile and output the .js file
# listen for compilation output type .d.ts file
# listen to the component compile and output the .css file
npm run start
# Step 2, development mode, listen to compile preview website instance
npm run doc
```

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

<!--rehype:ignore:end-->

A simple markdown editor with preview, implemented with React.js and TypeScript. This React Component aims to provide a simple Markdown editor with syntax highlighting support. This is based on `textarea` encapsulation, so it does not depend on any modern code editors such as Acs, CodeMirror, Monaco etc.

### Features

- 📑 Indent line or selected text by pressing tab key, with customizable indentation.
- ♻️ Based on `textarea` encapsulation, does not depend on any modern code editors.
- 🚧 Does not depend on the [`uiw`](https://github.com/uiwjs/uiw) component library.
- 🚘 Automatic list on new lines.
- 😻 GitHub flavored markdown support.
- 🌒 Support dark-mode/night-mode **@v3.11.0+**.
- 💡 Support [next.js](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-md-editor/issues/52#issuecomment-848969341), [Use examples](#support-nextjs) in [next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

### Quick Start

```bash
npm i @uiw/react-md-editor
```

### Using

[![Open in CodeSandbox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-CodeSandbox-blue?logo=codesandbox)](https://codesandbox.io/embed/markdown-editor-for-react-izdd6?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark)
[![Open in Github gh-pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20In-Github%20gh--pages-blue?logo=github)](https://uiwjs.github.io/react-md-editor/)
[![Open in Gitee gh-pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20In-Gitee%20gh--pages-blue?logo=web)](https://uiw.gitee.io/react-md-editor/)

```jsx mdx:preview
import React from "react";
import MDEditor from '@uiw/react-md-editor';

export default function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState("**Hello world!!!**");
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <MDEditor
        value={value}
        onChange={setValue}
      />
      <MDEditor.Markdown source={value} style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap' }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Special Markdown syntax

**Supports for CSS Style**

Use HTML comments `<!--rehype:xxx-->`<!--rehype:style=color: red; font-weight: bold;--> to let Markdown support style customization.

```markdown
## Title
<!--rehype:style=display: flex; height: 230px; align-items: center; justify-content: center; font-size: 38px;-->

Markdown Supports **Style**<!--rehype:style=color: red;-->
```

**Ignore content display via HTML comments**

Shown in GitHub readme, excluded in HTML.

```markdown
# Hello World

<!--rehype:ignore:start-->Hello World<!--rehype:ignore:end-->

Good!
```

Output:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Good!</p>
```

### Security

Please note markdown needs to be sanitized if you do not **completely trust** your authors.
Otherwise, your app is vulnerable to XSS. This can be achieved by adding [rehype-sanitize](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize) as a plugin.

```jsx mdx:preview
import React from "react";
import MDEditor from '@uiw/react-md-editor';
import rehypeSanitize from "rehype-sanitize";

export default function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(`**Hello world!!!** <IFRAME SRC=\"javascript:javascript:alert(window.origin);\"></IFRAME>`);
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <MDEditor
        value={value}
        onChange={setValue}
        previewOptions={{
          rehypePlugins: [[rehypeSanitize]],
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```bash
npm install next-remove-imports
npm install @uiw/react-md-editor@v3.6.0
```

```js
// next.config.js
const removeImports = require('next-remove-imports')();
module.exports = removeImports({});
```

```jsx
import "@uiw/react-md-editor/markdown-editor.css";
import "@uiw/react-markdown-preview/markdown.css";
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
import { useState } from "react";

const MDEditor = dynamic(
  () => import("@uiw/react-md-editor"),
  { ssr: false }
);

function HomePage() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("**Hello world!!!**");
  return (
    <div>
      <MDEditor value={value} onChange={setValue} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

### Support dark-mode/night-mode

By default, the [`dark-mode`](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/dark-mode/) is automatically switched according to the system. If you need to switch manually, just set the `data-color-mode="dark"` parameter for body. 

```html
<html data-color-mode="dark">
```

```js
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-color-mode', 'dark')
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-color-mode', 'light')
```

Inherit custom color variables by adding [`.wmde-markdown-var`](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-markdown-preview/blob/a53be1e93fb1c2327649c4a6b084adb80679affa/src/styles/markdown.less#L1-L193) selector. Setting theme styles with `data-color-mode="light"`.

```html
<div data-color-mode="light">
  <div className="wmde-markdown-var"> </div>
  <MDEditor source="Hello World!" />
</div>
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - boolbase@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

#boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - dlv@1.1.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `dlv(obj, keypath)` [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dlv.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/dlv) [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv)

> Safely get a dot-notated path within a nested object, with ability to return a default if the full key path does not exist or the value is undefined


### Why?

Smallest possible implementation: only **130 bytes.**

You could write this yourself, but then you'd have to write [tests].

Supports ES Modules, CommonJS and globals.


### Installation

`npm install --save dlv`


### Usage

`delve(object, keypath, [default])`

```js
import delve from 'dlv';

let obj = {
	a: {
		b: {
			c: 1,
			d: undefined,
			e: null
		}
	}
};

//use string dot notation for keys
delve(obj, 'a.b.c') === 1;

//or use an array key
delve(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']) === 1;

delve(obj, 'a.b') === obj.a.b;

//returns undefined if the full key path does not exist and no default is specified
delve(obj, 'a.b.f') === undefined;

//optional third parameter for default if the full key in path is missing
delve(obj, 'a.b.f', 'foo') === 'foo';

//or if the key exists but the value is undefined
delve(obj, 'a.b.d', 'foo') === 'foo';

//Non-truthy defined values are still returned if they exist at the full keypath
delve(obj, 'a.b.e', 'foo') === null;

//undefined obj or key returns undefined, unless a default is supplied
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c') === undefined;
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c', 'foo') === 'foo';
delve(obj, undefined, 'foo') === 'foo';
```


### Setter Counterparts

- [dset](https://github.com/lukeed/dset) by [@lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed) is the spiritual "set" counterpart of `dlv` and very fast.
- [bury](https://github.com/kalmbach/bury) by [@kalmbach](https://github.com/kalmbach) does the opposite of `dlv` and is implemented in a very similar manner.

## API

This module exports the identifier [`factorySpace`][api-factory-space].
There is no default export.

### `factorySpace(…)`

Parse spaces and tabs.

There is no `nok` parameter:

*   spaces in markdown are often optional, in which case this factory can be
    used and `ok` will be switched to whether spaces were found or not
*   one line ending or space can be detected with `markdownSpace(code)` right
    before using `factorySpace`

###### Examples

Where `␉` represents a tab (plus how much it expands) and `␠` represents a
single space.

```markdown
␉
␠␠␠␠
␉␠
```

###### Parameters

*   `effects` (`Effects`)
    — context
*   `ok` (`State`)
    — state switched to when successful
*   `type` (`string`)
    — type (`' \t'`)
*   `max` (`number`, default: `Infinity`)
    — max (exclusive)

###### Returns

Start state (`State`).

(see `asciiAlpha`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiAtext(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents an ASCII atext.

atext is an ASCII alphanumeric (see `asciiAlphanumeric`), or a character in
the inclusive ranges U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (`#`) to U+0027 APOSTROPHE (`'`),
U+002A ASTERISK (`*`), U+002B PLUS SIGN (`+`), U+002D DASH (`-`), U+002F
SLASH (`/`), U+003D EQUALS TO (`=`), U+003F QUESTION MARK (`?`), U+005E

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to splice for giant arrays, which V8 bugs
out on.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-chunked
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {push, splice} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-chunked@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {push, splice} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-chunked@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {push, splice} from 'micromark-util-chunked'

// …

nextEvents = push(nextEvents, [
  ['enter', events[open][1], context],
  ['exit', events[open][1], context]
])

// …

splice(events, open - 1, index - open + 3, nextEvents)

// …
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`push`][api-push]
and [`splice`][api-splice].
There is no default export.

### `push(list, items)`

Append `items` (an array) at the end of `list` (another array).
When `list` was empty, returns `items` instead.

This prevents a potentially expensive operation when `list` is empty,
and adds items in batches to prevent V8 from hanging.

###### Parameters

*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — list to operate on
*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — items to add to `list`

###### Returns

Either `list` or `items` (`Array<unknown>`).

### `splice(list, start, remove, items)`

Like `Array#splice`, but smarter for giant arrays.

`Array#splice` takes all items to be inserted as individual argument which
causes a stack overflow in V8 when trying to insert 100k items for instance.

Otherwise, this does not return the removed items, and takes `items` as an
array instead of rest parameters.

###### Parameters

*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — list to operate on
*   `start` (`number`)
    — index to remove/insert at (can be negative)
*   `remove` (`number`)
    — number of items to remove
*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — items to inject into `list`

###### Returns

Nothing (`void`).

```

## Use

```js
import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference'

decodeNumericCharacterReference('41', 16) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('65', 10) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('A', 16) // '\n'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('7F', 16) // '�' - Control
decodeNumericCharacterReference('110000', 16) // '�' - Out of range
```

## API

This module exports the identifier:
[`decodeNumericCharacterReference`][api-decode-numeric-character-reference].
There is no default export.

### `decodeNumericCharacterReference(value, base)`

Turn the number (in string form as either hexa- or plain decimal) coming from
a numeric character reference into a character.

Sort of like `String.fromCharCode(Number.parseInt(value, base))`, but makes
non-characters and control characters safe.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — value to decode
*   `base` (`number`, probably `10` or `16`)
    — numeric base

###### Returns

Character (`string`).

## What is this?

This package exposes a list of known tag names to markdown.

## When should I use this?

This package is only useful if you want to build an alternative to micromark.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-html-tag-name
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'micromark-util-html-tag-name'

console.log(htmlBlockNames) // ['address', 'article', …]
console.log(htmlRawNames) // ['pre', 'script', …]
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`htmlBlockNames`][api-html-block-names]
and [`htmlRawNames`][api-html-raw-names].
There is no default export.

### `htmlBlockNames`

List of lowercase HTML “block” tag names (`Array<string>`).

The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in more relaxed rules (condition
6\).
Because they are known blocks, the HTML-like syntax doesn’t have to be strictly
parsed.
For tag names not in this list, a more strict algorithm (condition 7) is used
to detect whether the HTML-like syntax is seen as HTML (flow) or not.

This is copied from:
<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.

> 👉 **Note**: `search` was added in `CommonMark@0.31`.

### `htmlRawNames`

List of lowercase HTML “raw” tag names (`Array<string>`).

The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in HTML that can include lines
without exiting, until a closing tag also in this list is found (condition
1\).

This module is copied from:
<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.

> 👉 **Note**: `textarea` was added in `CommonMark@0.30`.

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to normalize identifiers found in markdown.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-normalize-identifier
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-normalize-identifier@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {normalizeIdentifier} from 'micromark-util-normalize-identifier'

normalizeIdentifier(' a ') // 'A'
normalizeIdentifier('a\t\r\nb') // 'A B'
normalizeIdentifier('ТОЛПОЙ') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'
normalizeIdentifier('Толпой') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'
```

## API

This module exports the identifier
[`normalizeIdentifier`][api-normalize-identifier].
There is no default export.

### `normalizeIdentifier(value)`

Normalize an identifier (as found in references, definitions).

Collapses markdown whitespace, trim, and then lower- and uppercase.

Some characters are considered “uppercase”, such as U+03F4 (`ϴ`), but if their
lowercase counterpart (U+03B8 (`θ`)) is uppercased will result in a different
uppercase character (U+0398 (`Θ`)).
So, to get a canonical form, we perform both lower- and uppercase.

Using uppercase last makes sure keys will never interact with default
prototypal values (such as `constructor`): nothing in the prototype of `Object`
is uppercase.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — identifier to normalize

###### Returns

Normalized identifier (`string`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

[micromark][] utility to resolve subtokens.

[Resolvers][resolver] are functions that take events and manipulate them.
This is needed for example because media (links, images) and attention (strong,
italic) aren’t parsed left-to-right.
Instead, their openings and closings are parsed, and when done, their openings
and closings are matched, and left overs are turned into plain text.
Because media and attention can’t overlap, we need to perform that operation
when one closing matches an opening, too.

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to make URLs safe.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-sanitize-uri
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {sanitizeUri} from 'micromark-util-sanitize-uri'

sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a&amp;b') // 'https://example.com/a&amp;amp;b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%b') // 'https://example.com/a%25b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%20b') // 'https://example.com/a%20b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/👍') // 'https://example.com/%F0%9F%91%8D'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/', /^https?$/i) // 'https://example.com/'
sanitizeUri('javascript:alert(1)', /^https?$/i) // ''
sanitizeUri('./example.jpg', /^https?$/i) // './example.jpg'
sanitizeUri('#a', /^https?$/i) // '#a'
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri] and
[`sanitizeUri`][api-sanitize-uri].
There is no default export.

### `normalizeUri(value)`

Normalize a URL.

Encode unsafe characters with percent-encoding, skipping already encoded
sequences.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — URI to normalize

###### Returns

Normalized URI (`string`).

### `sanitizeUri(url[, pattern])`

Make a value safe for injection as a URL.

This encodes unsafe characters with percent-encoding and skips already
encoded sequences (see [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri]).
Further unsafe characters are encoded as character references (see
[`micromark-util-encode`][micromark-util-encode]).

A regex of allowed protocols can be given, in which case the URL is sanitized.
For example, `/^(https?|ircs?|mailto|xmpp)$/i` can be used for `a[href]`, or
`/^https?$/i` for `img[src]` (this is what `github.com` allows).
If the URL includes an unknown protocol (one not matched by `protocol`, such
as a dangerous example, `javascript:`), the value is ignored.

###### Parameters

*   `url` (`string`)
    — URI to sanitize
*   `pattern` (`RegExp`, optional)
    — allowed protocols

###### Returns

Sanitized URI (`string`).

## Types

## What is this?

This package exposes constants used throughout the micromark ecosystem.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.
It’s useful to reference these constants by name instead of value while
developing.
[`micromark-build`][micromark-build] compiles them away for production code.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-symbol
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {codes} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol/codes@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {codes} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol/codes@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {codes} from 'micromark-util-symbol/codes'
import {constants} from 'micromark-util-symbol/constants'
import {types} from 'micromark-util-symbol/types'
import {values} from 'micromark-util-symbol/values'

console.log(codes.atSign) // 64
console.log(constants.characterReferenceNamedSizeMax) // 31
console.log(types.definitionDestinationRaw) // 'definitionDestinationRaw'
console.log(values.atSign) // '@'
```

## API

This package has four entries in its export map: `micromark-util-symbol/codes`,
`micromark-util-symbol/constants`, `micromark-util-symbol/types`,
`micromark-util-symbol/values`.

Each module exports an identifier with the same name (for example,
`micromark-util-symbol/codes` has `codes`), which is an object mapping strings
to other values.

See the code for the exposed data.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This package works with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to

## When should I use this?

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

See [§ Comparison][comparison] for more info

## What is this?

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

`micromark` is an open source markdown parser written in JavaScript.
It’s implemented as a state machine that emits concrete tokens, so that every
byte is accounted for, with positional info.
It then compiles those tokens directly to HTML, but other tools can take the
data and for example build an AST which is easier to work with
([`mdast-util-to-markdown`][mdast-util-to-markdown]).

While most markdown parsers work towards compliancy with CommonMark (or GFM),
this project goes further by following how the reference parsers (`cmark`,
`cmark-gfm`) work, which is confirmed with thousands of extra tests.

Other than CommonMark and GFM, micromark also supports common extensions to
markdown such as MDX, math, and frontmatter.

These npm packages have a sibling project in Rust:
[`markdown-rs`][markdown-rs].

*   for more about us, see [`unifiedjs.com`][site]
*   for updates, see [Twitter][]
*   for questions, see [Discussions][chat]
*   to help, see [contribute][] and [sponsor][] below

## Install

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

Typical use (buffering):

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'

console.log(micromark('## Hello, *world*!'))
```

Yields:

```html
<h2>Hello, <em>world</em>!</h2>
```

You can pass extensions (in this case [`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm]):

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'
import {gfm, gfmHtml} from 'micromark-extension-gfm'

const value = '* [x] contact@example.com ~~strikethrough~~'

const result = micromark(value, {
  extensions: [gfm()],
  htmlExtensions: [gfmHtml()]
})

console.log(result)
```

Yields:

```html
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> <a href="mailto:contact@example.com">contact@example.com</a> <del>strikethrough</del></li>
</ul>
```

Streaming interface:

```js
import {createReadStream} from 'node:fs'
import {stream} from 'micromark/stream'

createReadStream('example.md')
  .on('error', handleError)
  .pipe(stream())
  .pipe(process.stdout)

function handleError(error) {
  // Handle your error here!
  throw error
}
```

## API

`micromark` core has two entries in its export map: `micromark` and
`micromark/stream`.

`micromark` exports the identifier [`micromark`][api-micromark].
`micromark/stream` exports the identifier [`stream`][api-stream].
There are no default exports.

The export map supports the [`development` condition][development].
Run `node --conditions development module.js` to get instrumented dev code.
Without this condition, production code is loaded.
See [§ Size & debug][size-debug] for more info.

### `micromark(value[, encoding][, options])`

Compile markdown to HTML.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string` or [`Buffer`][buffer])
    — markdown to parse
*   `encoding` (`string`, default: `'utf8'`)
    — [character encoding][encoding] to understand `value` as when it’s a
    `Buffer`
*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    — configuration

###### Returns

Compiled HTML (`string`).

### `stream(options?)`

Create a duplex (readable and writable) stream.

Some of the work to parse markdown can be done streaming, but in the
end buffering is required.

micromark does not handle errors for you, so you must handle errors on whatever
streams you pipe into it.
As markdown does not know errors, `micromark` itself does not emit errors.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    — configuration

###### Returns

Duplex stream.

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

##### Fields

###### `allowDangerousHtml`

Whether to allow (dangerous) HTML (`boolean`, default: `false`).

The default is `false`, which still parses the HTML according to `CommonMark`
but shows the HTML as text instead of as elements.

Pass `true` for trusted content to get actual HTML elements.
See [§ Security][security].

###### `allowDangerousProtocol`

Whether to allow dangerous protocols in links and images (`boolean`, default:
`false`).

The default is `false`, which drops URLs in links and images that use dangerous
protocols.

Pass `true` for trusted content to support all protocols.

URLs that have no protocol (which means it’s relative to the current page, such
as `./some/page.html`) and URLs that have a safe protocol (for images: `http`,
`https`; for links: `http`, `https`, `irc`, `ircs`, `mailto`, `xmpp`), are
safe.
All other URLs are dangerous and dropped.
See [§ Security][security].

###### `defaultLineEnding`

Default line ending to use when compiling to HTML, for line endings not in
`value` (`'\r'`, `'\n'`, or `'\r\n'`; default: first line ending or `'\n'`).

Generally, `micromark` copies line endings (`\r`, `\n`, `\r\n`) in the markdown
document over to the compiled HTML.
In some cases, such as `> a`, CommonMark requires that extra line endings are
added: `<blockquote>\n<p>a</p>\n</blockquote>`.

To create that line ending, the document is checked for the first line ending
that is used.
If there is no line ending, `defaultLineEnding` is used.
If that isn’t configured, `\n` is used.

###### `extensions`

Array of syntax extensions (`Array<SyntaxExtension>`, default: `[]`).
See [§ Extensions][extensions].

###### `htmlExtensions`

Array of syntax extensions (`Array<HtmlExtension>`, default: `[]`).
See [§ Extensions][extensions].

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - murmurhash-js@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# MurmurHash.js

An optimized JavaScript implementation of the MurmurHash algorithms.

These algorithms take a JavaScript string (and a seed), and quickly create a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash from it. And by quick I mean sub-millisecond performance.

More information about these algorithms can be found at:

*	[MurmurHash Homepage](http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/)
*	[Wikipedia Entry on MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) 

## Install

    npm install murmurhash-js
    
## API

```javascript
var murmur = require("murmurhash-js")
```

### Methods

#### `murmur.murmur2(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur2 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

#### `murmur.murmur3(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur3 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

**Note** `require("murmur-hash")` is the same as `murmur.murmur3`

![Example implementation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonasBa/recent-searches/master/RecentSearchesUX.gif)

## The problem

Building recent searches experience can be trickier than you think (expiry of queries, ranking of recent queries, handling storage etc...)

## Solution
recent-searches module helps you build that experience without having to focus on the edge cases and technical details. If available, uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store suggestions cross sessions and in the rare cases where it might not be available uses a fallback memory storage, thus loosing it's cross session functionality.

__The module handles:__
- Searching and retrieving recent searches
- Ranking of searches and decaying their popularity (with different ranking options)
- Saving and expiring of searches through LocalStorage or MemoryStorage
- LocalStorage feature detection (with fallback to MemoryStorage)
- Safe LocalStorage usage (feature detection, limiting storage)

## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin that defines how to take HTML
as input and turn it into a syntax tree.
When it’s used, HTML can be parsed and other rehype plugins can be used after
it.

See [the monorepo readme][rehype] for info on what the rehype ecosystem is.

## When should I use this?

This plugin adds support to unified for parsing HTML.
You can alternatively use [`rehype`][rehype-core] instead, which combines
unified, this plugin, and [`rehype-stringify`][rehype-stringify].

When you’re in a browser, trust your content, don’t need positional info, and
value a smaller bundle size, you can use [`rehype-dom-parse`][rehype-dom-parse]
instead.

This plugin is built on [`parse5`][parse5] and
[`hast-util-from-parse5`][hast-util-from-parse5], which deal with HTML-compliant
tokenizing, parsing, and creating nodes.
rehype focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting such
internals away.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-parse
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import rehypeParse from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-parse@8?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeParse from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-parse@8?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following module `example.js`:

```js
import {unified} from 'unified'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeRemark from 'rehype-remark'
import remarkStringify from 'remark-stringify'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(rehypeParse)
    .use(rehypeRemark)
    .use(remarkStringify)
    .process('<h1>Hello, world!</h1>')

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

…running that with `node example.js` yields:

```markdown
# Hello, world!
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `rehypeParse`.

### `unified().use(rehypeParse[, options])`

Add support for parsing HTML input.

##### `options`

Configuration (optional).

###### `options.fragment`

Specify whether to parse as a fragment (`boolean`, default: `false`).
The default is to expect a whole document.
In document mode, unopened `html`, `head`, and `body` elements are opened.

###### `options.space`

Which space the document is in (`'svg'` or `'html'`, default: `'html'`).

When an `<svg>` element is found in the HTML space, `rehype-parse` already
automatically switches to and from the SVG space when entering and exiting it.

> 👉 **Note**: rehype is not an XML parser.
> It supports SVG as embedded in HTML.
> It does not support the features available in XML.
> Passing SVG files might break but fragments of modern SVG should be fine.

> 👉 **Note**: make sure to set `fragment: true` if `space: 'svg'`.

###### `options.emitParseErrors`

Emit [HTML parse errors][parse-errors] as warning messages
(`boolean`, default: `false`).

Specific rules can be turned off by setting their IDs in `options` to `false`
(or `0`).
The default, when `emitParseErrors: true`, is `true` (or `1`), and means that
rules emit as warnings.
Rules can also be configured with `2`, to turn them into fatal errors.

<!-- parse-error end -->

###### `options.verbose`

Add extra positional info (`boolean`, default: `false`).

## Examples

### Example: fragment versus document

The following example shows the difference between parsing as a document and
parsing as a fragment:

```js
import {unified} from 'unified'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

main()

async function main() {
  const doc = '<title>Hi!</title><h1>Hello!</h1>'

  console.log(
    String(
      await unified()
        .use(rehypeParse, {fragment: true})
        .use(rehypeStringify)
        .process(doc)
    )
  )

  console.log(
    String(
      await unified()
        .use(rehypeParse, {fragment: false})
        .use(rehypeStringify)
        .process(doc)
    )
  )
}
```

…yields:

```html
<title>Hi!</title><h1>Hello!</h1>
```

```html
<html><head><title>Hi!</title></head><body><h1>Hello!</h1></body></html>
```

> 👉 **Note**: observe that when a whole document is expected (second example),
> missing elements are opened and closed.

### Example: whitespace around and inside `<html>`

The following example shows how whitespace is handled when around and directly
inside the `<html>` element:

```js
import {unified} from 'unified'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

main(`<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>
  <head>
    <title>Hi!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  </body>
</html>`)

async function main(doc) {
  console.log(
    String(await unified().use(rehypeParse).use(rehypeStringify).process(doc))
  )
}
```

…yields (where `␠` represents a space character):

```html
<!doctype html><html lang="en"><head>
    <title>Hi!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
␠␠
</body></html>
```

> 👉 **Note**: observe that the line ending before `<html>` is ignored, the line
> ending and two spaces before `<head>` is moved inside it, and the line ending
> after `</body>` is moved before it.

This behavior is described by the HTML standard (see the section 13.2.6.4.1
“The ‘initial’ insertion mode” and adjacent states) which rehype follows.

The changes to this meaningless whitespace should not matter, except when
formatting markup, in which case [`rehype-format`][rehype-format] can be used to
improve the source code.

### Example: parse errors

The following example shows how HTML parse errors can be enabled and configured:

```js
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {unified} from 'unified'
import rehypeParse from 'rehype-parse'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(rehypeParse, {
      emitParseErrors: true, // Emit all.
      missingWhitespaceBeforeDoctypeName: 2, // Mark one as a fatal error.
      nonVoidHtmlElementStartTagWithTrailingSolidus: false // Ignore one.
    })
    .use(rehypeStringify)
    .process(`<!doctypehtml>
<title class="a" class="b">Hello…</title>
<h1/>World!</h1>`)

  console.log(reporter(file))
}
```

…yields:

```html
  1:10-1:10  error    Missing whitespace before doctype name  missing-whitespace-before-doctype-name  parse-error
  2:23-2:23  warning  Unexpected duplicate attribute          duplicate-attribute                     parse-error

2 messages (✖ 1 error, ⚠ 1 warning)
```

> 🧑‍🏫 **Info**: messages in unified are warnings instead of errors.
> Other linters (such as ESLint) almost always use errors.
> Why?
> Those tools *only* check code style.
> They don’t generate, transform, and format code, which is what rehype and
> unified focus on, too.
> Errors in unified mean the same as an exception in your JavaScript code: a
> crash.
> That’s why we use warnings instead, because we continue checking more HTML and
> continue running more plugins.

## Syntax

HTML is parsed according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used in rehype is [hast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
The extra types `Options`, `ErrorCode`, and `ErrorSeverity` are exported.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.

Use of rehype plugins could also open you up to other attacks.
Carefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.

For info on how to submit a report, see our [security policy][security].

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`rehypejs/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].
By interacting with this repository, organization, or community you agree to
abide by its terms.

**[rehype][]** plugin to add support for serializing HTML.

## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([rehype][]) plugin that defines how to take a
syntax tree as input and turn it into serialized HTML.
When it’s used, HTML is serialized as the final result.

See [the monorepo readme][rehype] for info on what the rehype ecosystem is.

## When should I use this?

This plugin adds support to unified for serializing HTML.
You can alternatively use [`rehype`][rehype-core] instead, which combines
unified, [`rehype-parse`][rehype-parse], and this plugin.

When you’re in a browser, trust your content, don’t need formatting options, and
value a smaller bundle size, you can use
[`rehype-dom-stringify`][rehype-dom-stringify] instead.

This plugin is built on [`hast-util-to-html`][hast-util-to-html], which turns
[hast][] syntax trees into a string.
rehype focusses on making it easier to transform content by abstracting such
internals away.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-stringify
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import rehypeStringify from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-stringify@9?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import rehypeStringify from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype-stringify@9?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following module `example.js`:

```js
import {unified} from 'unified'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await unified()
    .use(remarkParse)
    .use(remarkGfm)
    .use(remarkRehype)
    .use(rehypeStringify)
    .process('# Hi\n\n*Hello*, world!')

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

…running that with `node example.js` yields:

```html
<h1>Hi</h1>
<p><em>Hello</em>, world!</p>
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `rehypeStringify`.

### `unified().use(rehypeStringify[, options])`

Add support for serializing HTML.
Options are passed to [`hast-util-to-html`][hast-util-to-html].

##### `options`

Configuration (optional).

###### `options.entities`

Define how to create character references (`Object`, default: `{}`).
Configuration is passed to [`stringify-entities`][stringify-entities].
You can use the fields `useNamedReferences`, `useShortestReferences`, and
`omitOptionalSemicolons`.
You cannot use the fields `escapeOnly`, `attribute`, or `subset`).

###### `options.upperDoctype`

Use a `<!DOCTYPE…` instead of `<!doctype…`.
Useless except for XHTML (`boolean`, default: `false`).

###### `options.quote`

Preferred quote to use (`'"'` or `'\''`, default: `'"'`).

###### `options.quoteSmart`

Use the other quote if that results in less bytes (`boolean`, default: `false`).

###### `options.preferUnquoted`

Leave attributes unquoted if that results in less bytes (`boolean`, default:
`false`).

Not used in the SVG space.

###### `options.omitOptionalTags`

Omit optional opening and closing tags (`boolean`, default: `false`).
For example, in `<ol><li>one</li><li>two</li></ol>`, both `</li>` closing tags
can be omitted.
The first because it’s followed by another `li`, the last because it’s followed
by nothing.

Not used in the SVG space.

###### `options.collapseEmptyAttributes`

Collapse empty attributes: get `class` instead of `class=""` (`boolean`,
default: `false`).

Not used in the SVG space.

> 👉 **Note**: boolean attributes (such as `hidden`) are always collapsed.

###### `options.closeSelfClosing`

Close self-closing nodes with an extra slash (`/`): `<img />` instead of
`<img>` (`boolean`, default: `false`).
See `tightSelfClosing` to control whether a space is used before the slash.

Not used in the SVG space.

###### `options.closeEmptyElements`

Close SVG elements without any content with slash (`/`) on the opening tag
instead of an end tag: `<circle />` instead of `<circle></circle>` (`boolean`,
default: `false`).
See `tightSelfClosing` to control whether a space is used before the slash.

Not used in the HTML space.

###### `options.tightSelfClosing`

Do not use an extra space when closing self-closing elements: `<img/>` instead
of `<img />` (`boolean`, default: `false`).

> 👉 **Note**: only used if `closeSelfClosing: true` or
> `closeEmptyElements: true`.

###### `options.tightCommaSeparatedLists`

Join known comma-separated attribute values with just a comma (`,`), instead of
padding them on the right as well (`,␠`, where `␠` represents a space)
(`boolean`, default: `false`).

###### `options.tightAttributes`

Join attributes together, without whitespace, if possible: get
`class="a b"title="c d"` instead of `class="a b" title="c d"` to save bytes
(`boolean`, default: `false`).

Not used in the SVG space.

> 👉 **Note**: intentionally creates parse errors in markup (how parse errors
> are handled is well defined, so this works but isn’t pretty).

###### `options.tightDoctype`

Drop unneeded spaces in doctypes: `<!doctypehtml>` instead of `<!doctype html>`
to save bytes (`boolean`, default: `false`).

> 👉 **Note**: intentionally creates parse errors in markup (how parse errors
> are handled is well defined, so this works but isn’t pretty).

###### `options.bogusComments`

Use “bogus comments” instead of comments to save byes: `<?charlie>` instead of
`<!--charlie-->` (`boolean`, default: `false`).

> 👉 **Note**: intentionally creates parse errors in markup (how parse errors
> are handled is well defined, so this works but isn’t pretty).

###### `options.allowParseErrors`

Do not encode characters which cause parse errors (even though they work), to
save bytes (`boolean`, default: `false`).

Not used in the SVG space.

> 👉 **Note**: intentionally creates parse errors in markup (how parse errors
> are handled is well defined, so this works but isn’t pretty).

###### `options.allowDangerousCharacters`

Do not encode some characters which cause XSS vulnerabilities in older browsers
(`boolean`, default: `false`).

> ⚠️ **Danger**: only set this if you completely trust the content.

###### `options.allowDangerousHtml`

Allow `raw` nodes and insert them as raw HTML.
When falsey, encodes `raw` nodes (`boolean`, default: `false`).

> ⚠️ **Danger**: only set this if you completely trust the content.

###### `options.space`

Which space the document is in (`'svg'` or `'html'`, default: `'html'`).

When an `<svg>` element is found in the HTML space, `rehype-stringify` already
automatically switches to and from the SVG space when entering and exiting it.

> 👉 **Note**: rehype is not an XML parser.
> It supports SVG as embedded in HTML.
> It does not support the features available in XML.
> Passing SVG files might break but fragments of modern SVG should be fine.

###### `options.voids`

Tag names of elements to serialize without closing tag (`Array<string>`,
default: [`html-void-elements`][html-void-elements]).

Not used in the SVG space.

> 👉 **Note**: It’s highly unlikely that you want to pass this.
> It’s only really applicable to the `hast-util-to-html` utility.

[`rehype-parse`][rehype-parse] and [`rehype-stringify`][rehype-stringify].

See [the monorepo readme][rehype] for info on what the rehype ecosystem is.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package when you want to use unified, have HTML as input, and
want HTML as output.
This package is a shortcut for
`unified().use(rehypeParse).use(rehypeStringify)`.
When the input isn’t HTML (meaning you don’t need `rehype-parse`) or the
output is not HTML (you don’t need `rehype-stringify`), it’s recommended to
use `unified` directly.

When you’re in a browser, trust your content, don’t need positional info on
nodes or formatting options, and value a smaller bundle size, you can use
[`rehype-dom`][rehype-dom] instead.

When you want to inspect and format HTML files in a project on the command
line, you can use [`rehype-cli`][rehype-cli].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import {rehype} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype@12?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {rehype} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/rehype@12?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following module `example.js`:

```js
import {rehype} from 'rehype'
import rehypeFormat from 'rehype-format'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await rehype()
    .use(rehypeFormat)
    .process(`<!doctype html>
        <html lang=en>
<head>
    <title>Hi!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>

</body></html>`)

  console.error(String(file))
}
```

…running that with `node example.js` yields:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Hi!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## API

This package exports the following identifier: `rehype`.
There is no default export.

### `rehype()`

Create a new (unfrozen) unified processor that already uses `rehype-parse` and
`rehype-stringify` and you can add more plugins to.
See [`unified`][unified] for more information.

## Examples

### Example: passing options to `rehype-parse`, `rehype-stringify`

When you use `rehype-parse` or `rehype-stringify` manually you can pass options
to `use`.
Because both plugins are already used in `rehype`, that’s not possible.
To define options for them, you can instead pass options to `data`:

```js
import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
import {rehype} from 'rehype'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await rehype()
    .data('settings', {fragment: true, emitParseErrors: true, preferUnquoted: true})
    .process('<div title="a" title="b"></div>')

  console.error(reporter(file))
  console.log(String(file))
}
```

…yields:

```txt
  1:21-1:21  warning  Unexpected duplicate attribute  duplicate-attribute  parse-error

⚠ 1 warning
```

```html
<div title=a></div>
```

## Syntax

HTML is parsed according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used in rehype is [hast][].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
There are no extra types exported.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.

Use of rehype plugins could also open you up to other attacks.
Carefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.

For info on how to submit a report, see our [security policy][security].

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
