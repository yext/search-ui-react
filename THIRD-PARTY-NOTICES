      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - dlv@1.1.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `dlv(obj, keypath)` [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dlv.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/dlv) [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv)

> Safely get a dot-notated path within a nested object, with ability to return a default if the full key path does not exist or the value is undefined


### Why?

Smallest possible implementation: only **130 bytes.**

You could write this yourself, but then you'd have to write [tests].

Supports ES Modules, CommonJS and globals.


### Installation

`npm install --save dlv`


### Usage

`delve(object, keypath, [default])`

```js
import delve from 'dlv';

let obj = {
	a: {
		b: {
			c: 1,
			d: undefined,
			e: null
		}
	}
};

//use string dot notation for keys
delve(obj, 'a.b.c') === 1;

//or use an array key
delve(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']) === 1;

delve(obj, 'a.b') === obj.a.b;

//returns undefined if the full key path does not exist and no default is specified
delve(obj, 'a.b.f') === undefined;

//optional third parameter for default if the full key in path is missing
delve(obj, 'a.b.f', 'foo') === 'foo';

//or if the key exists but the value is undefined
delve(obj, 'a.b.d', 'foo') === 'foo';

//Non-truthy defined values are still returned if they exist at the full keypath
delve(obj, 'a.b.e', 'foo') === null;

//undefined obj or key returns undefined, unless a default is supplied
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c') === undefined;
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c', 'foo') === 'foo';
delve(obj, undefined, 'foo') === 'foo';
```


### Setter Counterparts

- [dset](https://github.com/lukeed/dset) by [@lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed) is the spiritual "set" counterpart of `dlv` and very fast.
- [bury](https://github.com/kalmbach/bury) by [@kalmbach](https://github.com/kalmbach) does the opposite of `dlv` and is implemented in a very similar manner.

    used and `ok` will be switched to whether spaces were found or not
*   one line ending or space can be detected with `markdownSpace(code)` right
    before using `factorySpace`

###### Examples

Where `␉` represents a tab (plus how much it expands) and `␠` represents a
single space.

```markdown
␉
␠␠␠␠
␉␠

IETF.

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiControl(code)`

Check whether a [character code][code] is an ASCII control character.

An **ASCII control** is a character in the inclusive range U+0000 NULL (NUL)
to U+001F (US), or U+007F (DEL).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiDigit(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents an ASCII digit (`0` through
`9`).

An **ASCII digit** is a character in the inclusive range U+0030 (`0`) to
U+0039 (`9`).

###### Parameters

through `f`, case insensitive, or `0` through `9`).

An **ASCII hex digit** is an ASCII digit (see `asciiDigit`), ASCII upper hex
digit, or an ASCII lower hex digit.

An **ASCII upper hex digit** is a character in the inclusive range U+0041
(`A`) to U+0046 (`F`).

An **ASCII lower hex digit** is a character in the inclusive range U+0061
(`a`) to U+0066 (`f`).

###### Parameters

*   `code` (`Code`)
    — code

###### Returns

Whether it matches (`boolean`).

### `asciiPunctuation(code)`

Check whether the [character code][code] represents ASCII punctuation.

An **ASCII punctuation** is a character in the inclusive ranges U+0021
EXCLAMATION MARK (`!`) to U+002F SLASH (`/`), U+003A COLON (`:`) to U+0040 AT

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to splice for giant arrays, which V8 bugs
out on.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-chunked
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {push, splice} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-chunked@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {push, splice} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-chunked@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {push, splice} from 'micromark-util-chunked'

// …

nextEvents = push(nextEvents, [
  ['enter', events[open][1], context],
  ['exit', events[open][1], context]
])

// …

splice(events, open - 1, index - open + 3, nextEvents)

// …
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`push`][api-push]
and [`splice`][api-splice].
There is no default export.

### `push(list, items)`

Append `items` (an array) at the end of `list` (another array).
When `list` was empty, returns `items` instead.

This prevents a potentially expensive operation when `list` is empty,
and adds items in batches to prevent V8 from hanging.

###### Parameters

*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — list to operate on
*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — items to add to `list`

###### Returns

Either `list` or `items` (`Array<unknown>`).

### `splice(list, start, remove, items)`

Like `Array#splice`, but smarter for giant arrays.

`Array#splice` takes all items to be inserted as individual argument which
causes a stack overflow in V8 when trying to insert 100k items for instance.

Otherwise, this does not return the removed items, and takes `items` as an
array instead of rest parameters.

###### Parameters

*   `list` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — list to operate on
*   `start` (`number`)
    — index to remove/insert at (can be negative)
*   `remove` (`number`)
    — number of items to remove
*   `items` (`Array<unknown>`)
    — items to inject into `list`

###### Returns

Nothing (`void`).

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to decode numeric character references.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {decodeNumericCharacterReference} from 'micromark-util-decode-numeric-character-reference'

decodeNumericCharacterReference('41', 16) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('65', 10) // 'A'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('A', 16) // '\n'
decodeNumericCharacterReference('7F', 16) // '�' - Control
decodeNumericCharacterReference('110000', 16) // '�' - Out of range
```

## API

This module exports the identifier:
[`decodeNumericCharacterReference`][api-decode-numeric-character-reference].
There is no default export.

### `decodeNumericCharacterReference(value, base)`

Turn the number (in string form as either hexa- or plain decimal) coming from
a numeric character reference into a character.

Sort of like `String.fromCharCode(Number.parseInt(value, base))`, but makes
non-characters and control characters safe.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — value to decode
*   `base` (`number`, probably `10` or `16`)
    — numeric base

###### Returns

Character (`string`).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

## What is this?

This package exposes a list of known tag names to markdown.

## When should I use this?

This package is only useful if you want to build an alternative to micromark.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-html-tag-name
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-html-tag-name@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {htmlBlockNames, htmlRawNames} from 'micromark-util-html-tag-name'

console.log(htmlBlockNames) // ['address', 'article', …]
console.log(htmlRawNames) // ['pre', 'script', …]
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`htmlBlockNames`][api-html-block-names]
and [`htmlRawNames`][api-html-raw-names].
There is no default export.

### `htmlBlockNames`

List of lowercase HTML “block” tag names (`Array<string>`).

The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in more relaxed rules (condition
6\).
Because they are known blocks, the HTML-like syntax doesn’t have to be strictly
parsed.
For tag names not in this list, a more strict algorithm (condition 7) is used
to detect whether the HTML-like syntax is seen as HTML (flow) or not.

This is copied from:
<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.

> 👉 **Note**: `search` was added in `CommonMark@0.31`.

### `htmlRawNames`

List of lowercase HTML “raw” tag names (`Array<string>`).

The list, when parsing HTML (flow), results in HTML that can include lines
without exiting, until a closing tag also in this list is found (condition
1\).

This module is copied from:
<https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#html-blocks>.

> 👉 **Note**: `textarea` was added in `CommonMark@0.30`.

normalizeIdentifier('ТОЛПОЙ') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'
normalizeIdentifier('Толпой') // 'ТОЛПОЙ'
```

## API

This module exports the identifier
[`normalizeIdentifier`][api-normalize-identifier].
There is no default export.

### `normalizeIdentifier(value)`

Normalize an identifier (as found in references, definitions).

Collapses markdown whitespace, trim, and then lower- and uppercase.

Some characters are considered “uppercase”, such as U+03F4 (`ϴ`), but if their
lowercase counterpart (U+03B8 (`θ`)) is uppercased will result in a different
uppercase character (U+0398 (`Θ`)).
So, to get a canonical form, we perform both lower- and uppercase.

Using uppercase last makes sure keys will never interact with default
prototypal values (such as `constructor`): nothing in the prototype of `Object`
is uppercase.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — identifier to normalize

###### Returns

Normalized identifier (`string`).

[micromark][] utility to resolve subtokens.

[Resolvers][resolver] are functions that take events and manipulate them.
This is needed for example because media (links, images) and attention (strong,
italic) aren’t parsed left-to-right.
Instead, their openings and closings are parsed, and when done, their openings
and closings are matched, and left overs are turned into plain text.
Because media and attention can’t overlap, we need to perform that operation
when one closing matches an opening, too.

## What is this?

This package exposes an algorithm to make URLs safe.

## When should I use this?

This package might be useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-sanitize-uri
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html

  import {sanitizeUri} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-sanitize-uri@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {sanitizeUri} from 'micromark-util-sanitize-uri'

sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a&amp;b') // 'https://example.com/a&amp;amp;b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%b') // 'https://example.com/a%25b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/a%20b') // 'https://example.com/a%20b'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/👍') // 'https://example.com/%F0%9F%91%8D'
sanitizeUri('https://example.com/', /^https?$/i) // 'https://example.com/'
sanitizeUri('javascript:alert(1)', /^https?$/i) // ''
sanitizeUri('./example.jpg', /^https?$/i) // './example.jpg'
sanitizeUri('#a', /^https?$/i) // '#a'
```

## API

This module exports the identifiers [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri] and
[`sanitizeUri`][api-sanitize-uri].
There is no default export.

### `normalizeUri(value)`

Normalize a URL.

Encode unsafe characters with percent-encoding, skipping already encoded
sequences.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — URI to normalize

###### Returns

Normalized URI (`string`).

### `sanitizeUri(url[, pattern])`

Make a value safe for injection as a URL.

This encodes unsafe characters with percent-encoding and skips already
encoded sequences (see [`normalizeUri`][api-normalize-uri]).
Further unsafe characters are encoded as character references (see
[`micromark-util-encode`][micromark-util-encode]).

A regex of allowed protocols can be given, in which case the URL is sanitized.
For example, `/^(https?|ircs?|mailto|xmpp)$/i` can be used for `a[href]`, or
`/^https?$/i` for `img[src]` (this is what `github.com` allows).
If the URL includes an unknown protocol (one not matched by `protocol`, such
as a dangerous example, `javascript:`), the value is ignored.

###### Parameters

*   `url` (`string`)
    — URI to sanitize
*   `pattern` (`RegExp`, optional)
    — allowed protocols

###### Returns

Sanitized URI (`string`).

## What is this?

This package exposes constants used throughout the micromark ecosystem.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you are making your own micromark extensions.
It’s useful to reference these constants by name instead of value while
developing.
[`micromark-build`][micromark-build] compiles them away for production code.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark-util-symbol
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {codes} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol/codes@1'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {codes} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark-util-symbol/codes@1?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {codes} from 'micromark-util-symbol/codes'
import {constants} from 'micromark-util-symbol/constants'
import {types} from 'micromark-util-symbol/types'
import {values} from 'micromark-util-symbol/values'

console.log(codes.atSign) // 64
console.log(constants.characterReferenceNamedSizeMax) // 31
console.log(types.definitionDestinationRaw) // 'definitionDestinationRaw'
console.log(values.atSign) // '@'
```

## API

This package has four entries in its export map: `micromark-util-symbol/codes`,
`micromark-util-symbol/constants`, `micromark-util-symbol/types`,
`micromark-util-symbol/values`.

Each module exports an identifier with the same name (for example,
`micromark-util-symbol/codes` has `codes`), which is an object mapping strings
to other values.

See the code for the exposed data.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports no additional types.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 16+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This package works with `micromark` version 3+.

## Security

This package is safe.
See [`security.md`][securitymd] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for how to
submit a security report.

## Contribute

See [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`micromark/.github`][health] for ways
to get started.
See [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.

This project has a [code of conduct][coc].

See [§ Comparison][comparison] for more info

## What is this?

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

`micromark` is an open source markdown parser written in JavaScript.
It’s implemented as a state machine that emits concrete tokens, so that every
byte is accounted for, with positional info.
It then compiles those tokens directly to HTML, but other tools can take the
data and for example build an AST which is easier to work with
([`mdast-util-to-markdown`][mdast-util-to-markdown]).

While most markdown parsers work towards compliancy with CommonMark (or GFM),
this project goes further by following how the reference parsers (`cmark`,
`cmark-gfm`) work, which is confirmed with thousands of extra tests.

Other than CommonMark and GFM, micromark also supports common extensions to
markdown such as MDX, math, and frontmatter.

These npm packages have a sibling project in Rust:
[`markdown-rs`][markdown-rs].

*   to learn markdown, see this [cheatsheet and tutorial][cheat]
*   for more about us, see [`unifiedjs.com`][site]
*   for updates, see [Twitter][]
*   for questions, see [Discussions][chat]
*   to help, see [contribute][] and [sponsor][] below

## Install

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install micromark
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {micromark} from 'https://esm.sh/micromark@3?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

<!-- Note: this section has to be in sync with the monorepo readme. -->

Typical use (buffering):

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'

console.log(micromark('## Hello, *world*!'))
```

Yields:

```html
<h2>Hello, <em>world</em>!</h2>
```

You can pass extensions (in this case [`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm]):

```js
import {micromark} from 'micromark'
import {gfm, gfmHtml} from 'micromark-extension-gfm'

const value = '* [x] contact@example.com ~~strikethrough~~'

const result = micromark(value, {
  extensions: [gfm()],
  htmlExtensions: [gfmHtml()]
})

console.log(result)
```

Yields:

```html
<ul>
<li><input checked="" disabled="" type="checkbox"> <a href="mailto:contact@example.com">contact@example.com</a> <del>strikethrough</del></li>
</ul>
```

Streaming interface:

```js
import {createReadStream} from 'node:fs'
import {stream} from 'micromark/stream'

createReadStream('example.md')
  .on('error', handleError)
  .pipe(stream())
  .pipe(process.stdout)

function handleError(error) {
  // Handle your error here!
  throw error
}
```

## API

`micromark` core has two entries in its export map: `micromark` and
`micromark/stream`.

`micromark` exports the identifier [`micromark`][api-micromark].
`micromark/stream` exports the identifier [`stream`][api-stream].
There are no default exports.

The export map supports the [`development` condition][development].
Run `node --conditions development module.js` to get instrumented dev code.
Without this condition, production code is loaded.
See [§ Size & debug][size-debug] for more info.

### `micromark(value[, encoding][, options])`

Compile markdown to HTML.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string` or [`Buffer`][buffer])
    — markdown to parse
*   `encoding` (`string`, default: `'utf8'`)
    — [character encoding][encoding] to understand `value` as when it’s a
    `Buffer`
*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    — configuration

###### Returns

Compiled HTML (`string`).

### `stream(options?)`

Create a duplex (readable and writable) stream.

Some of the work to parse markdown can be done streaming, but in the
end buffering is required.

micromark does not handle errors for you, so you must handle errors on whatever
streams you pipe into it.
As markdown does not know errors, `micromark` itself does not emit errors.

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    — configuration

###### Returns

Duplex stream.

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

##### Fields

###### `allowDangerousHtml`

Whether to allow (dangerous) HTML (`boolean`, default: `false`).

The default is `false`, which still parses the HTML according to `CommonMark`
but shows the HTML as text instead of as elements.

Pass `true` for trusted content to get actual HTML elements.
See [§ Security][security].

###### `allowDangerousProtocol`

Whether to allow dangerous protocols in links and images (`boolean`, default:
`false`).

The default is `false`, which drops URLs in links and images that use dangerous
protocols.

Pass `true` for trusted content to support all protocols.

URLs that have no protocol (which means it’s relative to the current page, such
as `./some/page.html`) and URLs that have a safe protocol (for images: `http`,
`https`; for links: `http`, `https`, `irc`, `ircs`, `mailto`, `xmpp`), are
safe.
All other URLs are dangerous and dropped.
See [§ Security][security].

###### `defaultLineEnding`

Default line ending to use when compiling to HTML, for line endings not in
`value` (`'\r'`, `'\n'`, or `'\r\n'`; default: first line ending or `'\n'`).

Generally, `micromark` copies line endings (`\r`, `\n`, `\r\n`) in the markdown
document over to the compiled HTML.
In some cases, such as `> a`, CommonMark requires that extra line endings are
added: `<blockquote>\n<p>a</p>\n</blockquote>`.

To create that line ending, the document is checked for the first line ending
that is used.
If there is no line ending, `defaultLineEnding` is used.
If that isn’t configured, `\n` is used.

###### `extensions`

Array of syntax extensions (`Array<SyntaxExtension>`, default: `[]`).
See [§ Extensions][extensions].

###### `htmlExtensions`

Array of syntax extensions (`Array<HtmlExtension>`, default: `[]`).
See [§ Extensions][extensions].

![Example implementation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonasBa/recent-searches/master/RecentSearchesUX.gif)

## The problem

Building recent searches experience can be trickier than you think (expiry of queries, ranking of recent queries, handling storage etc...)

## Solution
recent-searches module helps you build that experience without having to focus on the edge cases and technical details. If available, uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store suggestions cross sessions and in the rare cases where it might not be available uses a fallback memory storage, thus loosing it's cross session functionality.

__The module handles:__
- Searching and retrieving recent searches
- Ranking of searches and decaying their popularity (with different ranking options)
- Saving and expiring of searches through LocalStorage or MemoryStorage
- LocalStorage feature detection (with fallback to MemoryStorage)
- Safe LocalStorage usage (feature detection, limiting storage)

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
